Love of my life
You've hurt me
You've broken my heart
And now you leave me
Love of my life
Can't you see

Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life
Don't leave me
You've taken my love
You now desert me
Love of my life
Can't you see
